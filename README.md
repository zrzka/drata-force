# Drata force

There's no [Drata agent for
Fedora](https://help.drata.com/en/articles/4752916-installing-the-drata-agent-via-ubuntu-linux),
just Ubuntu. Another option is to take screenshots and upload them on a
monthly basis. My opinion on screenshots is well known, but whatever. A
checkmark is the goal here.

## Installation

Just run `install.sh` to create symbolic links inside `~/.local/bin`.

## Supported operating system

Fedora 42 & Wayland only.

I have no intention of adding support for another operating system.
